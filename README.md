# Google Ads MCP Server

This repo contains the source code for running an
[MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that interacts with the
[Google Ads API](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api).

## Tools

The server uses the
[Google Ads API](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/latest/overview)
to provide several
[Tools](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools) and [Resources](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools) for use with LLMs and AI agents.

### Tools available

- `search`: Retrieves information about the Google Ads account.
- `get_resource_metadata`: Retrieves metadata about a Google Ads API resource type, for example "campaign". This is useful to understand the structure of the data and what fields are available for querying.
- `list_accessible_customers`: Returns ids of customers directly accessible
  by the user authenticating the call.

### Configuring and Namespacing Tools

The Google Ads MCP server uses the `tools_config.yaml` to let you selectively enable or disable individual tools or tool categories (namespaces) and customize their namespace prefixes.

A default `tools_config.yaml` with all tools enabled is bundled with the package, so the server works out of the box with no extra setup. To customize your installation, the server resolves the configuration in the following order:

1. An explicit path set via the `GOOGLE_ADS_MCP_TOOLS_CONFIG` environment variable.
2. A `tools_config.yaml` file in the current working directory.
3. The default `tools_config.yaml` bundled with the package.

If an explicitly requested configuration file (via the environment variable) is missing, or any resolved file is invalid, the server raises an error and fails to start.

#### Configuration Example:
```yaml
namespaces:
  # Option 1: Enable category 'customers' with default prefix -> "customers_list_accessible_customers"
  customers: true

  # Option 2: Enable category 'search' with a custom prefix -> "query_search"
  search: "query"

  # Option 3: Fine-grained control over tools in a category
  metadata:
    enabled: true
    prefix: "metadata"
    enabled_tools:
      - get_resource_metadata: true
```


### Resources available

- `discovery-document`: Retrieve the Google Ads API discovery document. Provides the discovery document for the latest version of the Google Ads API, which describes the API surface, including resources, methods, and schemas. Host LLMs should access this resource to understand the structure of the Google Ads API and discover available features.
- `metrics`: Retrieve information about the metrics available for reporting in the Google Ads API.
- `segments`: Retrieve information about the segments available for reporting in the Google Ads API.
- `release-notes`: Retrieve the release notes for the latest version of the Google Ads API.

## Notes

1.  The MCP Server will expose your data to the Agent or LLM that you connect to it.
1.  If you have technical issues, please use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/googleads/google-ads-mcp/issues).
1.  To help us collect usage data, you will notice an extra header has been added to your API calls: this data is used to improve the product.

## Setup instructions

Setup involves the following steps:

1.  Configure Python.
1.  Configure Developer Token.
1.  Enable APIs in your project
1.  Configure Credentials.
1.  Configure your MCP client.

### Configure Python

[Install pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/#install-pipx).

### Configure Developer Token

Follow the instructions for [Obtaining a Developer Token](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/get-started/dev-token).

Your developer token must have at least [Explorer access](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/get-started/dev-token#access-levels) to query production accounts. New tokens may be automatically upgraded to Explorer access; if not, you can apply through the API Center. See the [access levels documentation](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/get-started/dev-token#access-levels) for details.

If you see the error *"The developer token is only approved for use with test
accounts"*, your token does not yet have access to production accounts. See the
[access levels documentation](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/access-levels)
for how to request the access level you need.

### Enable APIs in your project

[Follow the instructions](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6158841)
to enable the following APIs in your Google Cloud project:

* [Google Ads API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/googleads.googleapis.com)

### Configure Credentials
#### Option 1: Using FastMCP OAuth Proxy

The server supports FastMCP's [OAuth proxy](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/auth/oauth-proxy) feature for dynamic user authentication. This is useful when running the server as a web service.

To enable it, set the following environment variables:

- `GOOGLE_ADS_MCP_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`: Your Google Cloud OAuth 2.0 Client ID.
- `GOOGLE_ADS_MCP_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`: Your Google Cloud OAuth 2.0 Client Secret.
- `GOOGLE_ADS_MCP_BASE_URL`: (Optional) The base URL where the server is accessible (defaults to `http://localhost:8080`).
- `GOOGLE_ADS_MCP_JWT_SIGNING_KEY`: (Optional) Secret key used to sign FastMCP JWT tokens across multiple server instances or deployments.
- `GOOGLE_ADS_MCP_STORAGE_TYPE`: (Optional) Storage backend for OAuth state (`filetree`, `redis`, `firestore`, or `memory`).
- `GOOGLE_ADS_MCP_STORAGE_PATH`: (Optional) Directory path for `filetree` persistent storage.
- `GOOGLE_ADS_MCP_STORAGE_REDIS_URL`: (Optional) Redis URL for `redis` persistent storage.
- `GOOGLE_ADS_MCP_STORAGE_FIRESTORE_PROJECT`: (Optional) Google Cloud project for `firestore` persistent storage. Defaults to the project inferred from Application Default Credentials. Setting it selects the `firestore` backend even if `GOOGLE_ADS_MCP_STORAGE_TYPE` is unset.
- `GOOGLE_ADS_MCP_STORAGE_FIRESTORE_DATABASE`: (Optional) Firestore database name for `firestore` persistent storage. Defaults to `(default)`.
- `GOOGLE_ADS_MCP_STORAGE_ENCRYPTION_KEY`: (Optional) Encryption key for stored OAuth tokens.
- `GOOGLE_ADS_MCP_STORAGE_DISABLE_ENCRYPTION`: (Optional) Set to `true` to disable token encryption.

The `redis` and `firestore` backends need their storage library installed
alongside the server: `pip install py-key-value-aio[redis]` and
`pip install google-ads-mcp[firestore]` respectively.

Once this is enabled, you can authenticate to the API through your MCP client.

When these variables are set, the server automatically switches to the `streamable-http` transport (SSE/HTTP) instead of `stdio`.

You will need to run the server as a separate process and configure your MCP client to connect to the SSE endpoint (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/mcp`).

#### Option 2: Configure credentials using Application Default Credentials

Configure your [Application Default Credentials
(ADC)](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/provide-credentials-adc).
Make sure the credentials are for a user with access to your Google Ads
accounts or properties.

Credentials must include the Google Ads API scope:

```
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/adwords
```

Check out
[Manage OAuth Clients](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/15549257)
for how to create an OAuth client.

Here are some sample `gcloud` commands you might find useful:


- Set up ADC using user credentials and an OAuth desktop or web client after
  downloading the client JSON to `YOUR_CLIENT_JSON_FILE`.

  ```shell
  gcloud auth application-default login \
    --scopes https://www.googleapis.com/auth/adwords,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform \
    --client-id-file=YOUR_CLIENT_JSON_FILE
  ```

- Set up ADC using service account impersonation.

  ```shell
  gcloud auth application-default login \
    --impersonate-service-account=SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL \
    --scopes=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/adwords,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform
  ```

When the `gcloud auth application-default` command completes, copy the
`PATH_TO_CREDENTIALS_JSON` file location printed to the console in the
following message. You will need this for a later step!

```
Credentials saved to file: [PATH_TO_CREDENTIALS_JSON]
```

#### Option 3: Configure credentials using the Google Ads API Python client library.

[Follow the instructions](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/client-libs/python/)
to setup and configure the Google Ads API Python client library

If you have already done this and have a working `google-ads.yaml` , you can reuse this file!

In the utils.py file, change get_googleads_client() to use the load_from_storage() method.

### Configure your MCP client

Add the server to your MCP client's configuration. Below are examples for
popular clients.

#### Antigravity CLI / Antigravity Code Assist

1.  Install [Antigravity CLI](https://antigravity.google/product/antigravity-cli) or Antigravity Code Assist.

1.  Configure your server. Refer to the docs at [https://antigravity.google/docs/mcp](https://antigravity.google/docs/mcp) for details on setting up MCP servers.

- Option 1: Using FastMCP OAuth Proxy (Streamable HTTP)

  You can run the server as a separate process and configure your MCP client to connect to the SSE endpoint (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/mcp`).
  This also allows using FastMCP's [OAuth proxy](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/auth/oauth-proxy) feature for dynamic user authentication.

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "google-ads-mcp": {
          "httpUrl":"http://localhost:8080/mcp",
          "env": {
            "GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID": "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
            "GOOGLE_ADS_DEVELOPER_TOKEN": "YOUR_DEVELOPER_TOKEN"                        
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

- Option 2: the Application Default Credentials method

    Replace `PATH_TO_CREDENTIALS_JSON` with the path you copied in the previous
    step.

    We also recommend that you add a `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` attribute to the
    `env` object. Replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` in the following example with the
    [project ID](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/7014113) of your
    Google Cloud project.

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "google-ads-mcp": {
          "command": "pipx",
          "args": [
            "run",
            "--spec",
            "git+https://github.com/googleads/google-ads-mcp.git",
            "google-ads-mcp"
          ],
          "env": {
            "GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS": "PATH_TO_CREDENTIALS_JSON",
            "GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID": "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
            "GOOGLE_ADS_DEVELOPER_TOKEN": "YOUR_DEVELOPER_TOKEN"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

- Option 3: the Python client library method

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "google-ads-mcp": {
          "command": "pipx",
          "args": [
            "run",
            "--spec",
            "git+https://github.com/googleads/google-ads-mcp.git",
            "google-ads-mcp"
          ],
          "env": {
            "GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID": "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
            "GOOGLE_ADS_DEVELOPER_TOKEN": "YOUR_DEVELOPER_TOKEN"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

#### Login Customer Id

If your access to the customer account is through a manager account, you will
need to add the customer ID of the manager account to the settings file.

See [here](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/concepts/call-structure#cid) for details.

The final file will look like this:

  ```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "google-ads-mcp": {
        "command": "pipx",
        "args": [
          "run",
          "--spec",
          "git+https://github.com/googleads/google-ads-mcp.git",
          "google-ads-mcp"
        ],
        "env": {
          "GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS": "PATH_TO_CREDENTIALS_JSON",
          "GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID": "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
          "GOOGLE_ADS_DEVELOPER_TOKEN": "YOUR_DEVELOPER_TOKEN",
          "GOOGLE_ADS_LOGIN_CUSTOMER_ID": "YOUR_MANAGER_CUSTOMER_ID"
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

#### Subject Delegation (service accounts only)

If you authenticate with a service account key and need it to act on behalf of
a specific user, add the `GOOGLE_ADS_SUBJECT` environment variable with the
email address of the user to impersonate.

This only applies when `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` points to a service
account key. With user credentials or with the OAuth proxy (Option 1), the
variable is ignored and a warning is logged. The service account must have
domain-wide delegation enabled, with the
`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/adwords` scope granted by a Workspace
administrator.

See [Domain-wide delegation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/service-account#delegatingauthority)
for details.

The final file will look like this:

  ```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "google-ads-mcp": {
        "command": "pipx",
        "args": [
          "run",
          "--spec",
          "git+https://github.com/googleads/google-ads-mcp.git",
          "google-ads-mcp"
        ],
        "env": {
          "GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS": "PATH_TO_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON",
          "GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID": "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
          "GOOGLE_ADS_DEVELOPER_TOKEN": "YOUR_DEVELOPER_TOKEN",
          "GOOGLE_ADS_SUBJECT": "user@example.com"
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

#### Other MCP clients (Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code, etc.)

The `mcpServers` block format is the same across all MCP clients. Add the configuration shown above to the appropriate settings file for your client (e.g., `~/.claude/settings.json` for Claude Code, `.cursor/mcp.json` for Cursor, `.vscode/mcp.json` for VS Code with Copilot).

## Deployment to Google Cloud Platform

Instead of hosting this MCP server locally, you can host it on Google Cloud Run or on any other cloud-based infrastructure. This is useful if you want to share the server across different agents or run it as a web service.

Note that this only supports authentication with an OAuth Client ID and Client Secret pair through the OAuth proxy (Option #1 above).

### Prerequisites

1.  A Google Cloud project.
2.  The `gcloud` CLI installed, authenticated, and active project set.
    ```shell
    gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
    ```

### Step 1: Build and Push Docker Image

You can use Cloud Build to build and push the image to Artifact Registry without needing Docker installed locally.

1.  Create a repository in Artifact Registry:
    ```shell
    gcloud artifacts repositories create mcp-servers --repository-format=docker --location=us-central1
    ```
2.  Build and submit the image:
    ```shell
    gcloud builds submit --tag us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/mcp-servers/google-ads-mcp:latest .
    ```
    Replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` with your Google Cloud project ID.

### Step 2: Deploy to Google Cloud Run

Make sure to set the required environment variables:

- `GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID`: Your Google Cloud project ID.
- `GOOGLE_ADS_DEVELOPER_TOKEN`: The developer token you want the MCP server to use (see above).
- `GOOGLE_ADS_MCP_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`: The OAuth Client ID you want the MCP server to use.
- `GOOGLE_ADS_MCP_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`: The OAuth Client secret you want the MCP server to use.
- `GOOGLE_ADS_MCP_BASE_URL`: The base URL where your MCP server is accessible: this will be automatically assigned by Google Cloud Run after your first deployment. You can update the environment variables after deployment. 
- `GOOGLE_ADS_MCP_JWT_SIGNING_KEY`: (Recommended for production) Persistent JWT signing key across Cloud Run instances.
- `GOOGLE_ADS_MCP_STORAGE_TYPE`: (Recommended for production) Storage backend to persist OAuth tokens across instances. Set it to `firestore` to use Firestore through Application Default Credentials, which needs no VPC connector, or to `redis` along with `GOOGLE_ADS_MCP_STORAGE_REDIS_URL`.

  Using `firestore` requires three things: build the image with the extra
  installed (change the Dockerfile to `uv pip install --system .[firestore]`),
  create a Firestore database in the project, since one is not provisioned
  automatically, and grant the Cloud Run service account `roles/datastore.user`.
  Note that entries are not expired automatically: the store filters expired
  entries on read but never deletes them, and `expires_at` is written as a
  string, so a Firestore TTL policy cannot collect them either. Plan on a
  periodic cleanup job for long-running deployments. Redis expires entries on
  its own.
- `FASTMCP_HOST`: Set this to `0.0.0.0` to allow FastMCP to accept connections from all IP addresses.

```shell
gcloud run deploy google-ads-mcp \
  --image us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/mcp-servers/google-ads-mcp:latest \
  --platform managed \
  --region us-central1 \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --set-env-vars="GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_PROJECT_ID,GOOGLE_ADS_DEVELOPER_TOKEN=YOUR_DEVELOPER_TOKEN,GOOGLE_ADS_MCP_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_CLIENT_ID,GOOGLE_ADS_MCP_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET,GOOGLE_ADS_MCP_BASE_URL=YOUR_BASE_URL,GOOGLE_ADS_MCP_JWT_SIGNING_KEY=YOUR_JWT_SIGNING_KEY,GOOGLE_ADS_MCP_STORAGE_TYPE=firestore,FASTMCP_HOST=0.0.0.0"
```

### Step 3: Configure MCP Client

Once deployed, update your MCP client configuration (refer to the docs at [https://antigravity.google/docs/mcp](https://antigravity.google/docs/mcp)) to use the Cloud Run URL.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "google-ads-mcp": {
      "httpUrl": "https://your-cloud-run-url.a.run.app/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## Try it out

Launch your MCP client. You should see `google-ads-mcp` listed in the
available servers.

Here are some sample prompts to get you started:

- Ask what the server can do:

  ```
  what can the ads-mcp server do?
  ```

- Ask about customers:

  ```
  what customers do I have access to?
  ```

- Ask about campaigns 

  ```
  How many active campaigns do I have?
  ```

  ```
  How is my campaign performance this week?
  ```

### Note about Customer ID

Your agent will need and ask for a customer id for most prompts. If you are 
moving between multiple customers, including the customer ID in the prompt may
be simpler.

```
How many active campaigns do I have for customer id 1234567890
```
