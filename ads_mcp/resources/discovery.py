    Provides the discovery document for the Google Ads API, which

    Use this resource to get a high-level overview of the API surface or to find
    available resources. However, for finding specific fields, you MUST use the
    `get_resource_metadata` tool instead, as it provides more targeted and
    up-to-date information for queries.
