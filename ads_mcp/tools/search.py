### Hints
    Language Grammar can be found at https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/query/grammar
    All resources and descriptions are found at https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/fields/v21/overview

    For Conversion issues try looking in offline_conversion_upload_conversion_action_summary

### Hint for customer_id
    should be a string of numbers without punctuation
    if presented in the form 123-456-7890 remove the hyphens and use 1234567890

### Hints for Dates
    All dates should be in the form YYYY-MM-DD and must include the dashes (-)
    Date literals from the Grammar must NEVER be used
    Date ranges should be finite and must include a start and end date

### Hints for limits
    Requests to resource change_event must specify a LIMIT of less than or equal to 10000

### Hints for conversions questions
    https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/conversions/upload-summaries 


### Hints for all fields
    What follows is a table of resources and their selectable fields (fields), filterable fields (used in the condition) and sortable fields (use in the ordering)
    Fields are comma separated, the whole field must be used, wildcards and partial fields are not allowed
    All fields must come from this table and be prefixed with the resource being searched
